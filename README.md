### Project Title
US Bikeshare - Citizen Data Scientist 

### Description
The main foundation of this project is to study the behavior of bicycle rentals for following cities below:
Chicago, New York City and Washington.
In order to explore the project, three .csv files were made available, which contain historical data such as:
date of rental, place where it was collected and delivered, gender and whether the customer is a subscriber or not. From this information,
it is possible to analyze the main profile of people who rented bicycles
within the period in which the data were collected. The period analyzed is the first 6 months of 2017.
For the development of the project, we use the python programming language and the modules
numpy, panda. All development was carried out with the help of Anaconda's command terminal.
